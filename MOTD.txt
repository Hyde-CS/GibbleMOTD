Welcome to GIBBLE!

Hey! Thanks for checking out GIBBLE in its early beta. I know things look rough right now, but this is just the very beginning of something much bigger. There are a few modes to try out so far, like Tag, a Tycoon, and some fun little extras around the map—but everything is still a huge work-in-progress.

I’m actively improving the game, adding new content, and polishing things up as fast as I can. Tag especially is super bare-bones at the moment, but the goal is to turn it into something fast, smooth, and chaotic—kind of like Untitled Tag Game on Roblox. It will get better.

Thank you for being here early. I hope you all stick around, give feedback, and watch the game grow over time. <3
